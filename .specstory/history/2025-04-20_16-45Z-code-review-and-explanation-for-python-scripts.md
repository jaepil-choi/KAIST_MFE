I have a question in #file:final_eda_1.py . 
In outlier detection, there are some advanced approaches like Isolation forest and local outlier factor. 

Explain these two methods. From concept to hwo they work (mechanism) and what are the characteristics of each, and what are pros and cons.

# Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor: Advanced Outlier Detection Methods

## 1. Isolation Forest

### Concept
Isolation Forest is based on the principle that outliers are "few and different" and thus easier to isolate than normal points. Unlike traditional methods that model normal behavior first, Isolation Forest directly identifies anomalies by isolating them.

### How it works (Mechanism)
1. **Random Partitioning**:
   - Randomly selects a feature
   - Randomly selects a split value between the feature's min and max
   - Recursively partitions data until points are isolated
   - Builds multiple isolation trees (similar to random forest)

2. **Path Length Measurement**:
   - Outliers require fewer splits (shorter paths) to be isolated
   - Normal points require more splits (longer paths)
   - Average path length across multiple trees becomes the anomaly score

3. **Scoring**:
   - Points with shorter average path lengths are more likely outliers
   - The `contamination` parameter (seen in the code as 0.05) specifies expected proportion of outliers

### Pros
- **Efficient**: O(n log n) complexity, works well on large datasets
- **High-dimensional friendly**: Performs well in high-dimensional spaces
- **Scalable**: Computationally efficient with low memory usage
- **Distribution-agnostic**: No assumptions about data distribution
- **Handles varying densities**: Works across different density regions

### Cons
- **Inconsistency**: Random nature can lead to different results between runs
- **Parameter sensitivity**: Performance depends on number of trees and tree depth
- **Limited interpretability**: Difficult to explain why a point is flagged
- **Struggles with clustered outliers**: Less effective when outliers form groups

## 2. Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

### Concept
LOF is a density-based method that detects outliers based on local density deviations. It identifies points that have significantly lower density than their neighbors.

### How it works (Mechanism)
1. **k-Distance Calculation**:
   - For each point, find k-nearest neighbors
   - Calculate distance to the kth neighbor (k-distance)

2. **Reachability Distance**:
   - Maximum of actual distance and neighbor's k-distance
   - Smooths distance measure to reduce statistical fluctuations

3. **Local Reachability Density (LRD)**:
   - Inverse of average reachability distance to neighbors
   - Measures how densely packed a point is relative to neighbors

4. **LOF Calculation**:
   - Compare point's LRD with LRDs of its neighbors
   - LOF > 1 indicates potential outlier (lower density than neighbors)
   - Higher LOF values suggest stronger outlier characteristics

### Pros
- **Local sensitivity**: Detects local outliers missed by global methods
- **Handles varying densities**: Works well with clusters of different densities
- **Interpretable scores**: LOF values indicate degree of "outlierness"
- **Distribution-agnostic**: No assumptions about underlying distribution
- **Adaptive**: Adapts to local context of each data point

### Cons
- **Computationally expensive**: O(n²) complexity due to distance calculations
- **Memory intensive**: Requires storing distance matrices for large datasets
- **Sensitive to parameter k**: Performance varies with neighborhood size
- **Curse of dimensionality**: Performance degrades in high dimensions
- **Struggles with outlier clusters**: Less effective when outliers form groups

## Key Differences

1. **Approach**: 
   - Isolation Forest: Isolation-based (how easily can a point be separated?)
   - LOF: Density-based (how different is a point's density from its neighbors?)

2. **Computational efficiency**:
   - Isolation Forest: More efficient (O(n log n))
   - LOF: Less efficient (O(n²))

3. **Dimensionality handling**:
   - Isolation Forest: Better for high-dimensional data
   - LOF: Performance degrades in high dimensions

4. **Sensitivity to local structures**:
   - Isolation Forest: Less sensitive to local density variations
   - LOF: Highly sensitive to local density patterns

In the provided code, both methods are used with a contamination parameter of 0.05, meaning they're configured to identify approximately 5% of data points as outliers, though they likely identify different outliers due to their distinct approaches.
