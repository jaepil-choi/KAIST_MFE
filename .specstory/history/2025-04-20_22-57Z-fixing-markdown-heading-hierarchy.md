# Fixing Markdown Heading Hierarchy (2025-04-20 22:57Z)

Let's fix markdown format.
Currently, markdown heading hierarchy is messed up. You should check markdown hierarchy and make it into one consistent format.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the file, I notice there are markdown cells mixed with code cells in what appears to be a Jupyter notebook that's been exported to a Python script. The markdown hierarchy seems inconsistent in a few places.

Let me examine the current hierarchy structure:

1. There are top-level markdown sections marked with `# %% [markdown]` followed by headings like `# Title`
2. Some subsections use `# %% [markdown]` followed by headings like `## 1. Title`
3. Some sub-subsections use `# %% [markdown]` followed by headings like `### 1.1 Title`

The issue seems to be that some sections have inconsistent heading levels or skip levels.

Let me check for specific issues:

1. In the first part (Q1), the structure seems mostly consistent, starting with main headings like `## 1. Data Load` and then subheadings like `### 2.1 Categorical Variable Visualization`. This follows a logical hierarchy.

2. In the second part (Q2), we also see a consistent structure starting with `## 1. Data Load and Check` and then subheadings like `### 2.1 Original Data Distribution Check`.

3. In the third part (Q3), there's a section that starts with `## 3. Housing Price Data` which seems oddly numbered given that it's the first section in part 3. Also, the next level uses `### 1. Finding the Optimal Split in XGBoost` which is inconsistent with the numbering.

The main issues seem to be:
- Some inconsistency in the numbering scheme across different parts
- Some parts might be skipping heading levels
- The overall structure could be more clearly delineated between the major questions (Q1, Q2, Q3)

I'll need to revise the markdown hierarchy to ensure a consistent structure throughout the document, making sure each question has properly nested headers that follow a logical sequence.</details></think>

I'll fix the markdown hierarchy in the file to make it consistent. Let me examine and edit the file structure.

I've examined the markdown structure in the file and found some inconsistencies that need to be fixed. I'll now edit the file to create a consistent heading hierarchy throughout the document.

The markdown heading hierarchy has been successfully fixed in the file. The changes implemented include:

1. Changed the Q3 section heading from `## 3. 주택 가격 데이터` to `# BAF660 빅데이터와 금융자료분석 - 기말대체과제 Q3 (주택 가격 데이터)` to match the format of Q1 and Q2 sections.

2. Changed the sub-headings in Q3 from `### 1. XGBoost 최적 분할 찾기` and `### 2. 결측값 처리` to `## 1. XGBoost 최적 분할 찾기` and `## 2. 결측값 처리` to maintain consistent heading levels.

3. Removed an empty markdown cell at the end of the file.

Now the document has a consistent heading structure where:
- Level 1 headings (`#`) indicate the main sections (Q1, Q2, Q3)
- Level 2 headings (`##`) indicate major subsections
- Level 3 headings (`###`) indicate minor subsections
- Level 4 headings (`####`) indicate detailed topics

This hierarchical structure should make the document more organized and easier to navigate.
