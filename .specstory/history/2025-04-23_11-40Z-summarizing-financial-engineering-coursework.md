# Summarizing financial engineering coursework (2025-04-23 11:40Z)

_**User**_

As you can see from the folder names, this is a project folder that I worked on for various projects on various courses. 

Below is the full list of courses that I took. 

Focus on the courses that have folders. Then for each folder, skim over the files to see what I can say about these courses. 

The purpose of the writing: 

I'm writing 전공소개서, that summarizes what I've studied and achievced in my current field of study: Financial Engineering. 
전공소개서는 면접 시에 활용되므로, 전공 학업내역, 논문, 수행프로젝트 등을 기재

As you can see, this will be used in the interview so you need to pick 대표 과목 & 대표 프로젝트 that shows my work. 

For example, in @BAF663자계추/ I replicated from the groud up fama french factors following the rigorous process. In @BAF634고금계/ I generated 5 major factors using Korean market data from ground up and also structured OOP architectured code to properly do the research.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating course documentation**

I’m reviewing whether we used tools to analyze the folder contents. Since it's not necessary, I can mention the time series analysis without specific filings. The user wants to focus on courses that have folders, so I’ll skim through five folders to find key projects. Some notable courses include BAF663, BAF634, and BAF645, each with different focus areas. I need to create a clear summary to highlight technical skills and provide relevant code snippets as evidence.
**Structuring project summaries**

I’m trying to formulate short suggestions for flagship projects using concise bullet points, focusing on clarity while keeping verbosity low. I also need to create a structured outline for a "전공소개서" along with a reusable summary in English and maybe a short Korean tagline. However, since the user prefers English, I’ll stick to that. We should prioritize critical analysis with evidence from the transcript to evaluate which folders genuinely reflect depth and research-grade work before proposing flagship projects. I'll skim through these files to gather relevant insights.
**Summarizing folder analyses**

I want to provide a brief overview of what each folder's content reveals. For example, in BAF634, I’ll mention how it involves working with FnGuide Data, building data pipelines, and applying filters for the financial sector. I need to keep my explanations concise, using minimal code lines while ensuring I include at least one line per block, cited properly. It’s important to start with a status update since we used tools like functions.list_dir and read_file, so I'll include a micro-update at the top of my message.
**Drafting the final message**

I need to draft my final message including a status update since I used tools this turn. I’ll start with "I scanned the attached course folders and opened key files to extract concrete evidence for representative projects." Then, I’ll provide a summary highlighting selected flagship courses and projects while emphasizing their impact. I want to be concise and avoid verbosity, so I'll keep the content structured yet minimal, only including necessary code excerpts without worrying about indentation. Lastly, I’ll ensure to use headings with '###' for clarity.
**Running additional checks**

I’m planning to run more checks in this turn while remembering to include a micro update before the new batch. I can run list_dir for folders like BAF642시계열, BAF515금공프3, BAF603선옵, BAF660_빅데, and BAF628 기간구조. The workspace snapshot gives me some counts for BAF642, which is helpful. I want to make sure to gather information preferencing the tools. I’ll also check BAF673알고리즘황근호 for mean reversion and cointegration. It seems we can run these in parallel with five calls using multi_tool_use.parallel. Let’s proceed with that!</details></think>

---

I’ll expand the scan to a few more course folders to ground brief, accurate summaries and pick representative projects.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Preparing Interview Summary**

I’m tasked with creating a summary for the interview 전공소개서 based on courses that have folders. I’ll skim through the files in each folder to outline what I can say about these courses and my achievements. I need to focus on representative courses and projects, like replicating the Fama French model in BAF663자계추 and generating major factors in BAF634고금계. I’ll ensure to critically evaluate claims and provide evidence-driven reasoning while organizing the information clearly.
**Organizing Code Evidence**

I need to include code citations using the CITING_CODE method, ensuring I reference the necessary content while highlighting key evidence. I’ve already accessed files from various courses, including BAF634, BAF663, and more. The user wants me to focus on representative courses, so I’ll create a structured list that summarizes major courses and projects. I’ll use bullet points to outline courses, skills, methods, outcomes, and provide project descriptions with results, using both Korean and English for clarity.
**Responding with Language Consistency**

The user is Korean and initially asked in English, but included some Korean, specifically "전공소개서." I need to respond fully in English to follow their rules about language consistency. I’ll bold key concepts and provide reasons and examples with code snippet citations to support my claims. It's essential to critically assess statements like "generated 5 major factors" by checking the relevant code. For instance, in BAF634, I’ll reference specific lines from the fndata.py to support the structured OOP architecture claims.
**Citing Code for Projects**

I’ll cite code for the user’s projects to provide concrete evidence. For BAF663자계추, the script replicates SAS to Python using OLS with HAC Newey-West, so I’ll include citations for constructing value-weighted portfolios and computing BM5-BM1 returns, specifically in apply_ff3reg_by_group (L207-L228) and final_table (L261-L279).

For BAF645파생거래전략, I’ll detail the option data scraping from KRX, including functions like generate_date_range (L72-L93) and fetch_option_data (L95-L118). I’ll also mention the backup setup with HDF5, which spans from L510-L657.
**Citing Relevant Code**

I need to cite the relevant code for the user’s projects. For BAF641수치해석, I’ll reference parts of the finite difference American option pricer, including boundary conditions and Greeks by citing specific line numbers.

For BAF653알고리즘, I'll mention the theoretical formulation in `OrderFlowForStudent.py`, including relevant sections on SDEs. In BAF642시계열, I'll open the `baf642_시계열_hw1_최재필_v1.py` file for citation, plus `MyUtil/MyTimeSeries.py` to demonstrate OOP structure. I'll also check BAF673 and BAF660 for additional relevant citations. I'll ensure to follow the user’s request for a clear deliverable with bullet points and relevant outcomes.</details></think>

---

I'll open representative files in time series, algorithmic trading, and big data folders to extract concrete evidence I can cite for your 소개서.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Preparing interview summary**

I need to create an interview-ready summary focusing on courses that include folders and representative projects. The user provided a list of courses to consider, emphasizing those with folders in their project. I'll skim the files in the workspace layout and select projects that best showcase their work. Examples include BAF663, which created Fama-French factors, and BAF634, which developed major factors using Korean market data. I’ll also look into projects related to BAF645 and BAF641.
**Creating structured overview**

I'm focusing on BAF653, which involves optimal execution with order flow. The code isn't fully implementing loops, but it shows a solid structure. There’s also information on algorithmic trading through a vectorbt backtest in BAF673. BAF642 has ARIMA-GARCH analysis along with a pair trading plan, though it isn’t fully implemented. BAF660 involves big data techniques including EDA pipelines and various clustering methods. I plan to create a concise overview using headings and bullet points, citing specific code lines to support my claims.
**Detailing course components**

For BAF663, I want to highlight the CAPM/FF3 regression function, specifically `apply_ff3reg_by_group`. In BAF645, I'll show functions like `generate_date_range`, `fetch_option_data`, and `scrape_krx_option_data`, along with references to retry mechanisms and H5 data handling, citing code from lines 558 onwards. For BAF641, I’ll reference the `fd_american_option` function header and its loops. BAF653 will showcase the objective function block, while BAF673 includes vectorbt-based backtesting metrics. Lastly, I’ll reference the `adf_result` function for BAF642’s ARIMA and GARCH applications.
**Preparing major introduction**

The user is asking for a 전공소개서 to use in interviews. I need to include representative courses and projects, outlining accomplishments, tools, methods, and outcomes. The format should ideally be short bullet points that highlight aspects like novelty, scale, reproducibility, and statistical rigor. I'll make sure to mention topics like OOP and error handling, and consider data sources such as KRX, FnGuide, and CRSP, especially in relation to the Korean market. I should also propose 3–5 flagship courses or projects.
**Assembling the deliverable**

I’m starting with a "Critical Evaluation" section stating that our assertion about building FF factors is backed by code implementing value-weighted portfolio returns by BM quintiles and HAC NW regression. I'll list relevant courses and projects under "Representative Courses and Projects."

This includes Asset Pricing Econometrics (BAF663), Advanced Financial Econometrics (BAF634), Derivatives Trading Strategies (BAF645), Numerical Methods in Finance (BAF641), Algorithmic Trading & Quant Strategies (BAF673/BAF653), Financial Time Series (BAF642), and Big Data (BAF660). Next, I'll propose 3-5 flagship picks for interviews, ensuring crisp bullet points for suggested talking points. I'll stick to the format and avoid unnecessary details.</details></think>

- **Critical evaluation (evidence-based):**
  - Your claim of “replicating Fama–French factors from scratch” is supported by code that constructs value-weighted portfolios (ME-lagged weighting), forms BM5–BM1 long–short spreads, merges FF factors, and runs CAPM/FF3 time-series regressions with Newey–West/HAC errors by group.
```53:86:BAF663자계추/Assignment 3/baf663_hw3_jaepilchoi.py
portfolio['eretadj_ME'] = (portfolio['eretadj']*100)*portfolio['ME_lag1']
...
portfolio2 = portfolio.groupby(['date', 'p1', 'p2'], as_index=False).agg(
    {'eretadj_ME': 'sum', 'ME_lag1': 'sum',}
)
portfolio2['vw_pret'] = portfolio2['eretadj_ME'] / portfolio2['ME_lag1']
...
portfolio4['vw_pret'] = portfolio4[5] - portfolio4[1]
```
```166:179:BAF663자계추/Assignment 3/baf663_hw3_jaepilchoi.py
portfolio6 = pd.merge(portfolio5, ff3, on=['year', 'month'], how='left')
portfolio6 = portfolio6.sort_values(by=['p1', 'p2', 'date'])
```
```207:229:BAF663자계추/Assignment 3/baf663_hw3_jaepilchoi.py
def apply_ff3reg_by_group(group, max_lag=6):
    y = group['vw_pret']
    X = group[['mktrf', 'hml', 'smb']]
    X = sm.add_constant(X)
    model = OLS(y, X).fit(cov_type='HAC', cov_kwds={'maxlags': max_lag}, kernel='bartlett')
    ...
    return result
```
  - Your claim of “Korean market factor construction with OOP architecture” is confirmed by a reusable ETL class with melt→pivot, type enforcement, data governance filters (금융섹터/관리/정지 제외), and universe building. It exposes long/wide retrieval with unit normalization.
```56:73:BAF634고금계/hw1/fndata.py
self.fn1_df = FnStockData._melt_dataguide_csv(filepath, encoding=encoding)
self.items = self.fn1_df['Item Name '].unique()
...
self.long_format_df = self._pivot_numerics()
self._preprocess_numerics()
self.filter_dfs = self._make_filters()
self._apply_filters()
self.univ_list = self._get_univ_list()
```
```121:136:BAF634고금계/hw1/fndata.py
finance_sector = self._pivot_nonnumeric('FnGuide Sector')
finance_sector = finance_sector[finance_sector['FnGuide Sector'] == '금융']
is_under_supervision = self._pivot_nonnumeric('관리종목여부')
is_trading_halted = self._pivot_nonnumeric('거래정지여부')
return [finance_sector, is_under_supervision, is_trading_halted]
```
```180:237:BAF634고금계/hw1/fndata.py
def get_data(self, item: list | str | None =None, multiindex: bool =True):
    ...
    if item in FnStockData.DIV_BY_100: data = data / 100
    elif item in FnStockData.MULTIPLY_BY_1000: data = data * 1000
```
  - Your KRX option project includes a robust scraping pipeline (date batching, retries/backoff, HDF5 append, periodic backups) and symbol parsing/column normalization for tidy panel data.
```72:93:BAF645파생거래전략/final_hw/option_data_krx.py
def generate_date_range(start_date: str, end_date: str) -> List[str]:
    tz = ZoneInfo('Asia/Seoul')
    ...
    if current_date.weekday() < 5:
        date_list.append(current_date.strftime("%Y%m%d"))
```
```558:575:BAF645파생거래전략/final_hw/option_data_krx.py
def setup_session() -> requests.Session:
    session = requests.Session()
    session.headers.update(HEADERS)
    retry_strategy = Retry(total=5, status_forcelist=[400, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
                           method_whitelist=["POST"], backoff_factor=1)
```
```594:609:BAF645파생거래전략/final_hw/option_data_krx.py
def save_data_h5(df: pd.DataFrame, filename: str):
    with pd.HDFStore(filename, mode='a') as store:
        store.append('option_data', df, format='table', data_columns=True)
def backup_h5_file(source: str, backup_path: Path):
    backup_path = BACKUP_PATH / f"krx_option_data_backup_{timestamp}.h5"
    shutil.copy(source, backup_path)
```
  - Numerics work is demonstrated by a PSOR-based finite-difference solver for American options with Greeks extraction.
```4:21:BAF641수치해석/hw1/fd_american_option.py
def fd_american_option(s, k, r, q, t, sigma, option_type, n, m):
    omega = 1.2; tol = 1e-6; max_iter = 10000
    S_max = s * 3; dS = S_max / n; dt = t / m
    asset_prices = np.linspace(0, S_max, n + 1)
    grid = np.zeros((m + 1, n + 1))
    if option_type.lower() == 'call':
        grid[-1, :] = np.maximum(asset_prices - k, 0)
```
```52:69:BAF641수치해석/hw1/fd_american_option.py
# PSOR
while error > tol and iteration < max_iter:
    ...
    V_temp = V_new[index] + omega * res / b[index]
    V_temp = max(V_temp, intrinsic[index])
    error = max(error, abs(V_temp - V_new[index]))
```
  - Time-series coursework covers stationarity testing and ARIMA–GARCH selection via AIC grid search.
```172:189:BAF642시계열/3주차과제/baf642_시계열_hw1_최재필_v1.py
def adf_result(data, regression='c', autolag='AIC', alpha=0.05):
    result = adfuller(data, regression=regression, autolag=autolag,)
    ...
```
```288:304:BAF642시계열/3주차과제/baf642_시계열_hw1_최재필_v1.py
pmd_model_v1x = auto_arima(v1x, seasonal=False, trace=True, suppress_warnings=True, stepwise=True)
pmd_model_v1x.fit(v1x)
```
```350:368:BAF642시계열/3주차과제/baf642_시계열_hw1_최재필_v1.py
for p, q in pq_space:
    garch_model_v1x = arch_model(arima_resid_v1x, vol='Garch', p=p, q=q)
    result_v1x = garch_model_v1x.fit(disp='off')
    ...
```
  - Big-data coursework shows a full ML pipeline: imbalanced learning (SMOTE/ADASYN), transformation/binning, KMeans vs DBSCAN selection by silhouette, and cluster profiling with radar charts.
```846:871:BAF660_빅데/기말대체과제/final_submission_jaepilchoi.py
kmeans_silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(X_card_power_df, kmeans_labels_final)

if kmeans_silhouette_avg >= dbscan_silhouette_avg:
    selected_model_name_q2 = "K-Means"
```
```901:938:BAF660_빅데/기말대체과제/final_submission_jaepilchoi.py
scaler_radar = MinMaxScaler()
radar_df_scaled = scaler_radar.fit_transform(final_cluster_analysis_radar)
def radar_chart(df, title):
    ...
```

### Representative courses and concrete projects (folders only)

- **BAF663 자산가격모형의 계량적 추정 (Asset Pricing Econometrics) — FF replication**
  - Built ME-lagged value-weighted portfolios, BM5–BM1 long–short, and tested alphas with CAPM/FF3 using HAC (Bartlett kernel) by size buckets; outputs consolidated into final tables of means and alphas.

- **BAF634 고급금융계량분석 — Korean factor research infra (OOP)**
  - Designed `FnStockData`/`FnMarketData` classes to melt→pivot FnGuide CSV, enforce numeric types, normalize units, filter governance flags, and construct investable universes. Produced long/wide factor-ready frames for downstream model research on KR market.

- **BAF645 파생상품 거래전략 — KRX options ETL and dataset assembly**
  - Implemented modular scraper with retry/backoff, weekday batching, HDF5 append, periodic backups, symbol parsing via regex, and tidy multi-index panel construction of OHLC/IV/OI for individual underlyings (e.g., Samsung). Prepared artifacts (`.pkl`, `.h5`) and configs for repeatable runs.

- **BAF641 금융수치해석기법 — American option FDM (PSOR)**
  - Wrote a PSOR loop with early-exercise constraint and stable boundary conditions, then interpolated price and computed Greeks (delta, gamma, theta) via finite differences.

- **BAF673 알고리즘 전략/BAF653 알고리즘 거래 — Backtesting and market exposure diagnostics**
  - Vectorized backtests with `vectorbt`, fee sensitivity analysis, and market neutrality checks (correlation/beta vs S&P 500; rolling correlations) to evaluate exposure and robustness under delays and transaction costs.

- **BAF642 금융시계열분석 — Stationarity + ARIMA–GARCH**
  - Conducted ADF/KPSS, automated ARIMA selection, residual GARCH(p,q) grid by AIC; set up VAR/VECM and pairs-trading sections for multi-variate and spread-based strategies.

- **BAF660 빅데이터와 금융자료 분석 — End-to-end EDA+ML**
  - Executed categorical encodings, cyclical features, outlier handling (IQR/IForest/LOF), power transforms, imbalanced sampling, KMeans vs DBSCAN selection via elbow/silhouette; built interpretable cluster profiles and t-SNE visualizations.

### 5 flagship, interview-ready picks

1) BAF634 고급금융계량분석 — KR equity factor research infra (OOP ETL, universe governance, factor-ready datasets).  
2) BAF663 자산가격모형의 계량적 추정 — FF factor reconstruction with NW/HAC alphas and 25-sorts.  
3) BAF645 파생상품 거래전략 — KRX options scraper + resilient data engineering (retry/HDF5/backups), tidy panel for IV/OI research.  
4) BAF641 금융수치해석기법 — American option FDM with PSOR and Greeks.  
5) BAF660 빅데이터 — Full ML workflow (imbalance handling, clustering selection, visualization) demonstrating breadth beyond finance-only methods.

### How to present in the interview (concise talking points)
- **Data engineering rigor**: KR-specific ETL with governance filters and unit normalization; reproducible factor/option datasets.  
- **Econometrics discipline**: Portfolio construction choices (ME lagging), HAC standard errors, controlled regressions by size/BM cells.  
- **Numerical methods**: PSOR convergence control, boundary conditions, stability choices, and Greeks extraction.  
- **Trading analytics**: Vectorized backtesting, fee/delay sensitivity, market-beta diagnostics to validate neutrality claims.  
- **ML competence**: Proper preprocessing, imbalance remedies, model selection metrics, and interpretable cluster profiles.

- Evidence and code references above directly substantiate these claims; avoid overclaiming specific performance numbers unless you bring the computed tables to the interview.

- If you want, I can compile a 1–page bilingual summary (KR/EN) with figures/tables extracted from your notebooks for each flagship project.

- I can also auto-generate an appendix of code excerpts (1–2 per project) to show rigor without overwhelming the interviewer.

- Prefer including a simple diagram for the BAF634 OOP data pipeline and the BAF645 scraping/backup flow.

- For BAF663, bring the final alpha table and a short note explaining Newey–West vs OLS.

- For BAF641, bring a figure of early-exercise boundary and a small table with Greeks at a few spots.

- For BAF660, bring the elbow plot and one radar chart.

- For BAF673/653, bring the correlation/beta plots and a fee-sensitivity panel.

- If time allows, I can export those now and assemble a one-pager.

- Let me know if you want a Korean narrative version tailored to “전공소개서” length limits.

- If you must pick only three: BAF634, BAF663, BAF645.

- I can also generate a markdown resume section with hyperlinks to these exact files.

- Finally, ensure you phrase contributions as design choices and reasoning, not only outputs (e.g., why ME lagging matters; why HAC; why HDF5 append).
