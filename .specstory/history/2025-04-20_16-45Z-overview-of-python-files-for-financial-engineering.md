# Code Explanation Based on Web Commentary Style

## Ch1_(1).py - Introduction to Python for Finance

This introductory script demonstrates Python's capabilities for financial analysis:

```python
# System configuration section
import datetime as dt
print("Current date and time:", dt.datetime.now())
print("Python version:", sys.version)
import platform
print("System info:", platform.platform())

# Scientific library setup
import numpy as np
print("NumPy version:", np.__version__)
import matplotlib as mpl
print("Matplotlib version:", mpl.__version__)

# Visualization example
x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
y1 = np.sin(x)
y2 = np.cos(x)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x, y1, 'b-', label='Sine')
plt.plot(x, y2, 'r--', label='Cosine')
plt.title('Basic Trigonometric Functions')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

The code establishes the foundation for financial modeling by:
- Setting up the Python environment with version checks
- Importing key scientific libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Creating a simple visualization to verify the setup works

This represents Step 1 of the quantitative finance journey: establishing the technical environment.

## Ch1_(2).py - Core Financial Mathematics

Building on the basics, this script introduces fundamental financial calculations:

```python
# Present value calculations
def present_value(future_value, rate, periods):
    """Calculate the present value of a future cash flow"""
    return future_value / (1 + rate)**periods

# Example cash flow calculations
cashflows = [100, 150, 200, 250, 300]
times = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rate = 0.05
pv_total = sum(present_value(cf, rate, t) for cf, t in zip(cashflows, times))
print(f"Present value of cash flows: ${pv_total:.2f}")

# Yield curve visualization
import pandas as pd
yields = pd.read_csv('yield_data.csv')
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(yields['Maturity'], yields['Rate'], 'bo-')
plt.title('US Treasury Yield Curve')
plt.xlabel('Maturity (years)')
plt.ylabel('Yield (%)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This script demonstrates:
- Implementation of time value of money concepts
- Discounting cash flows at various time periods
- Visualization of yield curves, a cornerstone of fixed income analysis

The code bridges theoretical finance concepts with practical implementation.

## Ch2.py - Portfolio Analysis and Risk Management

This script advances to portfolio theory and risk metrics:

```python
# Stock data analysis
import yfinance as yf
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG', 'AMZN']
data = yf.download(tickers, start='2020-01-01', end='2021-01-01')['Adj Close']
returns = data.pct_change().dropna()

# Calculate volatility
annual_vol = returns.std() * np.sqrt(252)
print("Annual volatility:")
print(annual_vol)

# Portfolio construction
weights = np.array([0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25])  # Equal weights
portfolio_return = np.sum(returns.mean() * weights) * 252
portfolio_vol = np.sqrt(weights.T @ returns.cov() * 252 @ weights)
sharpe_ratio = portfolio_return / portfolio_vol

print(f"Portfolio expected return: {portfolio_return:.4f}")
print(f"Portfolio volatility: {portfolio_vol:.4f}")
print(f"Sharpe ratio: {sharpe_ratio:.4f}")
```

The code illustrates:
- Downloading and processing financial time series
- Calculating key risk metrics like volatility
- Implementing portfolio construction techniques
- Computing portfolio performance measures

This represents the application of modern portfolio theory in Python.

## Ch3_notebook.py - Fixed Income Analysis

The final script focuses on bond pricing and interest rate modeling:

```python
# Bond pricing function
def bond_price(face_value, coupon_rate, years_to_maturity, yield_to_maturity, payments_per_year=2):
    """Calculate bond price using discounted cash flow approach"""
    periods = years_to_maturity * payments_per_year
    coupon_payment = face_value * coupon_rate / payments_per_year
    discount_rate = yield_to_maturity / payments_per_year
    
    # Calculate present value of all coupon payments
    coupon_pv = coupon_payment * (1 - (1 + discount_rate)**(-periods)) / discount_rate
    
    # Calculate present value of face value
    face_pv = face_value / (1 + discount_rate)**periods
    
    return coupon_pv + face_pv

# Example bond calculation
price = bond_price(1000, 0.05, 10, 0.06)
print(f"Bond price: ${price:.2f}")

# Interest rate simulation (Vasicek model)
def simulate_vasicek(r0, kappa, theta, sigma, T, steps):
    dt = T/steps
    rates = np.zeros(steps+1)
    rates[0] = r0
    
    for i in range(1, steps+1):
        dw = np.random.normal(0, np.sqrt(dt))
        rates[i] = rates[i-1] + kappa*(theta - rates[i-1])*dt + sigma*dw
    
    return rates

# Plot rate paths
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for _ in range(5):
    rates = simulate_vasicek(0.03, 0.3, 0.04, 0.01, 10, 1000)
    plt.plot(rates)
plt.title('Interest Rate Paths - Vasicek Model')
plt.xlabel('Time Steps')
plt.ylabel('Interest Rate')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This script showcases:
- Bond pricing mechanics using discounted cash flow approach
- Term structure modeling with the Vasicek model
- Stochastic interest rate simulation
- Visualization of multiple interest rate paths

The code demonstrates how to implement fixed income analytics for bond valuation and interest rate risk management.

Each file builds progressively on financial concepts, from basic setup to advanced modeling techniques, creating a comprehensive toolkit for quantitative finance applications.
