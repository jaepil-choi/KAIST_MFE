## Brief Intro to basics

- Python, Dev env, SQL
  - We will use `pandasql` package.
  - 이후엔 포트폴리오를 SQL로 짜는 것을 배울 것.

- feather vs parquet

| Aspect              | **Feather (Arrow IPC)**                  | **Parquet**                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Goal                | Fast local interchange/cache             | Efficient storage & analytics                        |
| Typical use         | Pandas/Arrow round-trips, features cache | Data lakes, large tables, BI/ETL                     |
| Speed (R/W)         | Very fast, minimal overhead              | Fast reads; writes do more work (encodings/stats)    |
| Size                | Usually larger                           | Usually smaller                                      |
| Compression         | v2: LZ4/ZSTD                             | Snappy/ZSTD/GZIP/Brotli/LZ4                          |
| Predicate pushdown  | Limited                                  | Strong (row-group/page stats)                        |
| Splittable/parallel | Not designed for row-group splits        | Splittable by row group; great for Spark/DuckDB/Dask |
| Types/schema        | Exact Arrow schema                       | Rich logical types; broad engine norms               |
| Best for            | Local caching, quick exchange            | Long-term, partitioned, query-heavy data             |
| Avoid if            | You need pruning/partitioned scale       | You just need tiny, transient caches                 |
